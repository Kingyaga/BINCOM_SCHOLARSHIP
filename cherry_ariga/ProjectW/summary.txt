2.3 Empirical Review:

The chapter reviews studies of related empirical research projects conducted in the same area. Several studies are mentioned:

Onyejelem and Onyejelem (2020) focused on "The influence of Pidgin English on educational outcomes among secondary school students in Nigeria." The research highlighted the negative effects of Pidgin English Language on students' oral English skills and their performance in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination.
Persis Adu-Boahen (2020) examined "The effects of Pidgin English on students' academic performance in English Language" at Adventist Senior High School, Bantama-Kumasi. The study found that students often preferred Pidgin language during casual conversations, which led to teachers advocating for fines when students used Pidgin English during speeches.
Obisike, Nwala, and Mbong (2019) investigated "The impact of Pidgin English on the effective learning of English Language among Junior Secondary School students in Port Harcourt." The study revealed challenges related to phonology and the usage of specific morphemes among students.
Leslie Acheson Wey (2019) explored "Does Using Local Pidgin Effect the Outcome of English Learning? The Case of Nigerian Students." The study indicated a significant relationship between Nigerian Pidgin and students' performance in English studies.
Myschool.ng (2013) released a research project on "The negative effects of Pidgin English in the university." The findings suggested that students commonly used Nigerian Pidgin, and it was viewed as having a place in university communication.

The "Methodology" chapter outlines the research procedures and methods used in the study and is divided into several sub-headings:

3.1 Research Design:

The study utilized a descriptive survey design, which aims to systematically and accurately describe a population, situation, or phenomenon. It is well-suited to answering "what, where, when, and how" questions and can employ a variety of research methods to investigate one or more variables.
3.2 Area of the Study:

The research focused on Junior Secondary Schools in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria.
3.3 Population of the Study:

The accessible population for the study comprised 200 students and 10 teachers from selected Public Junior Secondary Schools in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area.
3.4 Sample and Sampling Techniques:

The researchers selected Obio/Akpor Local Government Area due to its proximity to the researcher's residence and used convenience sampling for data collection. The sample size included 210 respondents, determined through simple random sampling from the selected schools.
3.5 Instrument for Data Collection:

The data collection instrument was a self-structured questionnaire named "Questionnaire on Effects of Pidgin English Language on teaching and learning in Junior Secondary Schools in Obio/Akpor LGA of Rivers State" (QEPELTLOLGARS). It consisted of a 38-item, four-option multiple choice objective test and was designed using a modified Likert scale.
3.6 Validity of the Instrument:

The research instrument underwent face and content validity assessment by the researcher's supervisor and two experts from the Department of Measurement and Evaluation at the University of Port Harcourt. Their input aimed to determine the suitability of the instrument for assessing the effects of Pidgin English Language on teaching and learning.
3.7 Reliability of the Instrument:

The internal consistency reliability of the test was assessed by the researcher using Cronbach's alpha coefficient to determine the instrument's reliability.
3.8 Method of Data Collection:

The data collection process began with a self-structured letter of introduction that granted the researcher access to respondents. A self-structured questionnaire was administered directly by the researcher and research assistants to the 210 respondents. The data collection process involved the collaboration of teachers and school management.
3.9 Method of Data Analysis:

Data analysis included both descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics, such as averages (means) and standard deviations, were used to answer research questions. Inferential statistics involved the use of an analytical regression model to test hypotheses and establish causal-effect relationships between dependent and independent variables.
3.9.1 Analytical Regression Model:

The research employed an analytical regression model, which consisted of a general linear equation to establish causal-effect relationships. The model included variables such as Effects on teaching and learning (EPER), Pidgin English (PDE), a constant term (Î±), and a standard error term (SE). This model aimed to demonstrate how the usage of Pidgin English affected teaching and learning, and it showed that the effects of Pidgin English on teaching and learning were inversely proportional to its usage. In simpler terms, when the effects of Pidgin English on teaching and learning were minimal or non-existent, the usage of Pidgin English by teachers and students was also reduced.
In summary, the "Methodology" chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the research design, data collection procedures, and statistical methods used in the study to investigate the effects of Pidgin English Language on teaching and learning in Junior Secondary Schools in Obio/Akpor LGA of Rivers State.
